Hi! This is **Xiang Li**, a senior undergraduate student at the **Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University**, majoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. My academic focus is on **machine learning theory**, and I am especially interested in understanding the principles that make learning algorithms both reliable and efficient. This motivation naturally leads to my research interests:  

**Research interests**  
- 🤖 Reinforcement learning (RL)  
- 📐 Optimization  
- 📊 Generalization and statistical learning theory  
- 🌌 Deep Learning and LLMs

Looking forward, I hope to contribute to advancing the theoretical foundations of machine learning while bridging them with practical advances in AI.  

I also maintain a [Bilibili Channel](https://space.bilibili.com/32773300?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0) (in Chinese), uploading videos related to the theory of machine learning, reinforcement learning and relevant mathematics. Feel free to take a look!
